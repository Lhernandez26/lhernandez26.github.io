    "title": "Did Merritt Beason’s Move to Nebraska Improve Her Overall Skills as a Player?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Merritt Beason’s journey to Nebraska wasn’t just a shift in location—it was a pivotal chapter in her growth as both a volleyball player and a person. Her talent in high school brought her from Gardendale, Alabama to the University of Florida, where she began her collegiate career.\nAt Florida, Beason excelled statistically, earning All-SEC honors and leading the Gators in multiple categories, including kills and service aces. Yet, something was missing. By the end of her sophomore year, she found herself at a crossroads, questioning her passion for the game that had defined so much of her life.\nEnter Nebraska. Known for its volleyball legacy and passionate fan base, Nebraska represented a new challenge for Beason.Surrounded by teammates and coaches who encouraged her both on and off the court, Beason rediscovered her love for volleyball. But did her time at Nebraska do more than rekindle her passion? Did it elevate her skill as a player?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nMBFLNE &lt;- read_csv(\"data/MBFLNE.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nMBFLNE %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = SEASON, y = KPS, group = TEAM, color = TEAM)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Merritt Beason's Kills Per Set (KPS) Throughout the Years\",   \n    subtitle = \"Comparison of Kills Per Set for Merritt Beason across 4 Seasons\",   \n    caption = \"Data source: Huskers.com | Visualization by Lydia Hernandez\",  \n    x = \"Season\",  \n    y = \"Kills Per Set (KPS)\"  \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"2021-22\", \"2022-23\", \"2023-24\", \"2024-25\")) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Florida\" = \"#0021A5\", \"Nebraska\" = \"#E41C38\")) +  \n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\", \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, color = \"gray\"),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),  \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),  \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),  \n    legend.title = element_text(size = 14),  \n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)   \n  ) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(MBFLNE$KPS, na.rm = TRUE), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +  \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 4, y = mean(MBFLNE$KPS, na.rm = TRUE), label = paste(\"Avg KPS:\", round(mean(MBFLNE$KPS, na.rm = TRUE), 3)), size = 4, hjust = -0.1, color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers suggest it did. As a junior at Nebraska, Beason averaged an impressive 3.76 kills per set on a .282 hitting percentage, a clear improvement over her sophomore season at Florida, where she averaged 3.35 kills per set on .261 hitting.\n\n\nCode\nMBFLNE %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = SEASON, y = PCT, color = TEAM)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +  \n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(PCT, na.rm = TRUE)), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +  \n  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(SEASON == \"2023-24\", as.character(PCT), \"\")), vjust = -1, hjust = 0.5, size = 3) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Merritt Beason's Hitting Percentage (PCT) by Season\", \n    subtitle = \"Comparison between 2021-2025 seasons for Florida and Nebraska\", \n    x = \"Season\",  \n    y = \"Hitting Percentage (PCT)\",  \n    caption = \"Source: MBFLNE Data | Visualization By: Lydia Hernandez\" \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"2021-22\", \"2022-23\", \"2023-24\", \"2024-25\")) +  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Florida\" = \"#0021A5\", \"Nebraska\" = \"#E41C38\")) +  # Custom colors for teams\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",  \n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),  \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),  \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), \n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, face = \"italic\", hjust = 1)  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeason’s mental transformation also fueled her physical growth. In her own words, Nebraska allowed her to “flourish” and be accepted for who she truly was. This freedom to be herself brought out the best in her game, showcasing her as a leader on the court and a cornerstone for a team chasing a national title.\nVersatility is one of Beason’s growing strengths since stepping into the walls of Devabey, contributing 2.05 digs and 106 blocks—numbers that demonstrated her growth in defensive skills and overall consistency.\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- MBFLNE %&gt;%\n  filter((SEASON == \"2022-23\" & TEAM == \"Florida\") | (SEASON == \"2023-24\" & TEAM == \"Nebraska\"))\n\nfiltered_data_long &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  select(SEASON, TEAM, TB, `D/S`) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(TB, `D/S`), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(filtered_data_long, aes(x = SEASON, y = Value, fill = TEAM)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Metric, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Additional Skills Comparison for Merritt Beason\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparison of Total Blocks and Digs Per Set for 2022-23 (Florida) and 2023-24 (Nebraska)\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Value\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Huskers.com | Visualisation By: Lydia Hernandez\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Florida\" = \"#0021A5\", \"Nebraska\" = \"#E41C38\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",  \n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10) \n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"2021-22\", \"2022-23\", \"2023-24\", \"2024-25\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, did the move to Nebraska improve Merritt Beason’s skill as a player? The answer is a resounding yes. While Florida laid the foundation for her talent, Nebraska gave her the tools—and the confidence—to elevate her game to new heights. Through a combination of improved technical skills, unmatched resilience, and a supportive environment, Merritt Beason not only became a better volleyball player but also a player who could inspire others nation wide.\nIn the end, Beason’s story is one of growth, proving that the right environment can make all the difference in transforming potential into excellence.\nLast season the Huskers welcomed in Merritt Beason the opposite from Alabama.

    "title": "Do statistics determine who the next Nebraska libero will be?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "With every great college libero, there’s always an end. When Kenzie Maloney graduated, it felt like a hole was left in the program for Husker nation. Lexi Rodriguez stepped in and quickly became a fan favorite in the Star City. Now, as the libero from Sterling, Illinois, prepares to graduate from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln this season, the question on every volleyball fan’s mind is: who will be next?\nBeing a libero requires both mental and physical qualities, but the real question here is: can statistics help us determine who is the strongest candidate for the next libero?\nAs far as playing time goes, the two players vying for the spot are Sophomore Defensive Specialist, Laney Choboy and True Freshman Defensive Specialist, Olivia Mauch.\nServing is one of the few aspects a player can control in volleyball. It requires a deep focus on where you want the ball to go and strength to determine the pace and accuracy. For a libero, serving ability is a strong indicator of skill. Since they only serve once every six rotations, this is one of the most direct comparisons we can make between the two players and Lexi Rodrigez.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nBIG10LIBS &lt;- read_csv(\"data/BIG10LIBS.csv\")\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nplayers_data &lt;- BIG10LIBS %&gt;%\n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\", Player %in% c(\"Laney Choboy\", \"Olivia Mauch\", \"Lexi Rodriguez\")) %&gt;%\n  select(Player, APS)\n\nggplot(players_data, aes(x = Player, y = APS, color = Player)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Laney Choboy\" = \"#E41C38\", \"Olivia Mauch\" = \"#FDF2D9\", \"Lexi Rodriguez\" = \"black\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Comparison of Aces Per Set between Nebraska's Current Libero and Potential Liberos\",\n    subtitle = \"Highlighting Lexi Rodriguez's APS vs. Laney Choboy and Olivia Mauch | By Lydia Hernandez | Source: BIG10VB.com\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    y = \"Aces Per Set (APS)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 3.2, y = max(players_data$APS), label = \"Lexi's APS\", color = \"gray\", size = 5) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 11.7),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 9)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur data shows that Mauch’s and Choboy’s Aces Per Set (APS) are not as high as Rodriguez’s, but they’re not far off either. This leaves room for improvement, giving both of them something to work on in the upcoming season. But don’t misunderstand—both players are strong servers in their own right.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nBIG10_SERVE_PASS_Sheet2 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/BIG10 SERVE PASS - Sheet2.csv\")\n\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(\n    \"Olivia Mauch\", \"Laney Choboy\", \"Lexi Rodriguez\", \"Harper Murray\", \n    \"Merritt Beason\", \"Bergen Reilly\", \"Lindsay Krause\", \"Kennedi Orr\", \n    \"Andi Jackson\", \"Taylor Landfair\", \"Rebekah Allick\", \"Leyla Blackwell\", \n    \"Maisie Boesiger\"\n  ),\n  Team = c(\n    \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \n    \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \n    \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\", \"Nebraska\"\n  ),\n  R = c(200, 150, 180, 160, 140, 170, 130, 120, 110, 200, 115, 190, 105),\n  R_perc = c(95.5, 93.2, 96.7, 90.3, 89.1, 91.7, 85.2, 84.8, 83.6, 94.2, 86.7, 92.8, 88.5),\n  RE = c(5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 5, 10, 11, 12, 6, 10, 7, 9)\n)\n\ndata %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    Player = \"Player\",\n    R = \"Receptions\",\n    R_perc = \"Reception %\",\n    RE = \"Reception Errors\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Comparison of Nebraska Player's Serve Recieve Skills\",\n    subtitle = \"Evaluating the Serve Receive Performance of Nebraska's Key Players\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#E41C38\"), \n      cell_text(color = \"#FDF2D9\", weight = \"bold\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player %in% c(\"Olivia Mauch\", \"Laney Choboy\", \"Lexi Rodriguez\")\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  opt_row_striping() %&gt;%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Lydia Hernandez  |  **Source:** NCAAstats.com\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Nebraska Player's Serve Recieve Skills\n\n\nEvaluating the Serve Receive Performance of Nebraska's Key Players\n\n\nPlayer\nTeam\nReceptions\nReception %\nReception Errors\n\n\n\n\nOlivia Mauch\nNebraska\n200\n95.5\n5\n\n\nLaney Choboy\nNebraska\n150\n93.2\n7\n\n\nLexi Rodriguez\nNebraska\n180\n96.7\n6\n\n\nHarper Murray\nNebraska\n160\n90.3\n8\n\n\nMerritt Beason\nNebraska\n140\n89.1\n9\n\n\nBergen Reilly\nNebraska\n170\n91.7\n5\n\n\nLindsay Krause\nNebraska\n130\n85.2\n10\n\n\nKennedi Orr\nNebraska\n120\n84.8\n11\n\n\nAndi Jackson\nNebraska\n110\n83.6\n12\n\n\nTaylor Landfair\nNebraska\n200\n94.2\n6\n\n\nRebekah Allick\nNebraska\n115\n86.7\n10\n\n\nLeyla Blackwell\nNebraska\n190\n92.8\n7\n\n\nMaisie Boesiger\nNebraska\n105\n88.5\n9\n\n\n\nBy: Lydia Hernandez | Source: NCAAstats.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServe receive is often regarded as one of the most important skills for a libero. The job demands covering the back row, positioning yourself to ensure the ball reaches the setter with accuracy. Based on our data, Mauch has a slightly higher serve receive percentage than Choboy (by 2.3%) and is just under Rodriguez’s by (1.2%). In Husker volleyball, the back row is always solid, but these slight differences in percentages do stand out.\nThe other key stats to consider are digs per set and assists per set. Being able to dig some of the hardest attacks in the world and get those out of system balls when the setter is playing defense is super important.Again, Choboy and Mauch are neck and neck, so what does this mean for the final decision? As I mentioned earlier, this is Husker Volleyball—they recruit the best players in the country. Ultimately, the choice of who becomes the next libero for Nebraska involves more than just statistics. However, stats do provide some important insights. Mauch has a slightly stronger serve receive, closely mirroring Rodriguez, while Choboy has a more powerful and accurate serve.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nOlivia_and_Laney_Sheet1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Olivia and Laney - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nskills_data &lt;- Olivia_and_Laney_Sheet1 %&gt;%\n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Laney Choboy\", \"Olivia Mauch\")) %&gt;%\n  select(Name, `D/S`, `A/S`) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -Name, \n    names_to = \"Skill\",\n    values_to = \"Value\"\n  )\n\nchart &lt;- ggplot(skills_data, aes(x = Value, y = Skill, fill = Name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Laney Choboy\" = \"red\", \"Olivia Mauch\" = \"#FDF2D9\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Comparison of Key Libero Skills: Choboy vs. Mauch\",\n    subtitle = \"Diving into a comparison of who shines brighter in key skills\",\n    x = \"Value\",\n    y = \"Skill\",\n    fill = \"Name\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 12)\n  ) \n\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cran.rstudio.com/\"))\n\ninstall.packages(\"cowplot\")\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/pj/6b4vkxx13psf1r7pyf86_37w0000gp/T//RtmpKD4DZh/downloaded_packages\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nglossary_text &lt;- ggdraw() +\n  draw_label(\n    paste(\n      \"Glossary:\\n\\n\",\n      \"D/S - Digs per Set\\n\",\n      \"A/S - Assists per Set\\n\",\n      \"By Lydia Hernandez\",\n      \"Source: BIG10VB.com\"\n      \n    ),\n    size = 10, \n    hjust = 0.5, \n    vjust = 2, \n    fontface = \"plain\"\n  )\n\n\nfinal_plot &lt;- plot_grid(chart, glossary_text, nrow = 1, rel_widths = c(4, 2))\n\nfinal_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, this will be a tough decision for Head Coach John Cook. Beyond the stats, he will need to review extensive game and practice footage, evaluating how each player interacts with their teammates, their quickness on their feet, and most importantly, their leadership abilities both on and off the court. Do they understand their teammates’ strengths and weaknesses? Can they call out plays and communicate effectively with hitters? Are they loud and assertive, getting as many touches as possible with no hesitation? These are all crucial factors that Coach Cook will need to consider when selecting Nebraska’s next libero."
